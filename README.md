WishList
========
Vision: Everyone should get what they wish

Let's create an application that enables this.
First of, you will be able to wish for something and someone could check this off if they could forfill that wish.
It needs some authentication with profile and memebership management.


Todo:
*apply design on wishlist (waiting for respons...)


Done:
*Updated the source to latest from http-server
*Change the source folder name to match the site url. 
*Add the settings.php to .gitignore
*Simplify robots.txt to disallow everything
*Redesign login.php for to be mobile friendly
*rename index.php till index.html using the api instead
